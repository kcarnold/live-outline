Acts 4:23

- A church’s prayer life—corporately as well as individually—is the clearest indicator of its spiritual vitality. But it does not come naturally for any of us.
- We all value tasks that produce visible results and immediate outcomes. Prayer is the opposite: it’s hard work that we can’t see
- Colossians 4:12: Epaphras always struggled in prayer for the church.
- There are at least 7 prayer meetings described in Acts.
  
  - Acts 2: they devoted themselves to the apostle’s teaching.
- Three points: Circumstances, content, and consequences of this prayer.
- Circumstances of this prayer
  
  - “When they were released” — Peter and John had been arrested because they would not cease preaching about Jesus Christ, and they had healed a man
  - They asked: “By what power and what means have you healed this man?” Peter took this opportunity to preach.
  - The religious leaders saw the boldness of Peter and John.
  - They put them in prison briefly, but released them and threatened them to not to preach.
  - So what did they do when they left the prison? They went to the church.
  - An encouragement for NCF: For 10 years at least, this has been a place where when people need help, people come to this place.
  - A church that prays together is a church that is united.
- The Contents of prayer: They acknowledge 3 important truths about God
  
  - The power of prayer is not in prayer itself, but in the one whom we lift our voices to.
  - The sovereign Lord made all things. He is the ruler of everything. God can help us with anything because he made everything.
    
    - “There is but one place of refuge, and that’s in God. … All is well, for God is on the throne.
    - Rather than “if God is sovereign, why pray?”, why not ask “if God was not sovereign, why would we bother going to him in prayer?”
  - He has spoken to them in his Word
    
    - When we pray the Scriptures, we pray God’s word back to him.
  - He has everything under control.
    
    - Herod and Pontius Pilate did only what God’s hand and plan had predestined.
    - “This Jesus, who was delivered over “...by the plans and purposes of God. So God is still in control in the midst of trouble, even, especially, in the persecution of the early church.
    - “God is still in control”
    - v29: “And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servant to continue to speak your word with all boldness.” — they do not pray for the persecution to stop.
    - Instead of allowing persecution to distract them,
    - They ask the Lord to empower them to do the very things that got them into this situation in the first place.
    - If God is going to do a mighty work among us, it’s going to be by prayer
- The Consequences of this prayer
  
  - “The place in which they were praying began to shake.”
  - We draw near to God together.
  - God fills us with his Spirit and empowers us for ministry.
  - God delights to answer prayers of his beloved people. As every father loves to answer the requests of his children
  - So let’s make requests of our big and glorious God.
  - “Praying Together” book — it’s not  merely a roster of individuals who pray privately, but a group of people who love to pray together.
