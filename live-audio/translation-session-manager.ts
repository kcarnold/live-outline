/**
 * TranslationSessionManager: supervises translator bridges by reconciling the set of
 * running bridges against LiveKit room presence — the single source of truth for demand.
 *
 * There is no listener refcount and no client beacon. Who is in the room, and what they
 * asked to hear (the `listen` participant attribute their token carries), IS the demand
 * signal; the supervisor loop diffs that against the bridges actually running and
 * starts, stops, or recreates bridges to close the gap. The loop runs on an interval
 * and on pokes (a token issued, a listener's /translate request), so every failure mode
 * that loses a bridge — server restart, room disconnect, a crashed start — heals on the
 * next tick as long as demand persists. Design rationale and the incident history are
 * in docs/live-audio-state-architecture.md.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const manager = TranslationSessionManager.getInstance();
 *   manager.init({ docFactory, livekit });       // once, at server boot
 *   const bridge = await manager.getOrCreate(sessionId, targetLanguage, organizerIdentity);
