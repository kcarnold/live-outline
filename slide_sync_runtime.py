"""The runtime: connects a SlideFeed to the Yjs consumers and manages the session lifecycle.

``SlideSyncRuntime`` is source-agnostic — it knows nothing about Proclaim. It owns the Yjs
document lifecycle, the Y-Sweet connection (lazy connect, reconnect with backoff, off-air
disconnect, keepalive health ping), and the per-cycle fan-out: one ``feed.poll()`` →
``publisher.apply`` (inline, one transaction) plus ``bus.publish`` to wake the background
translator.

What it no longer owns is *which doc* (issue #111). It used to compute that from the on-air
show's date, with a midnight-rollover rule bolted on — handling a day change that never
happens mid-service while missing the one that easily does, an older deck being opened
first. Now it proposes what it sees to the server before each session and connects to
whatever it is told. While connected it re-asks periodically and ends the session if the
answer moved, so an operator pin set mid-service reaches this service too — the doc itself
still only ever changes with nothing connected.

Because ``feed.poll()`` never raises on a source problem, the only exceptions the reconnect
loop handles are Y-Sweet/connection failures — a cleaner error boundary than the old
monolith, where a Proclaim hiccup and a websocket drop flowed through the same handler.
