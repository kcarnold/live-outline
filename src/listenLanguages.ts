// curated text-translation languages (configAtoms.ts), so it lives separately.

// The picker's "Original" entry is not in this list: it is whatever language the
// session is being spoken in (see liveAudioConfig.ts), which is a per-session fact
// rather than a constant — choosing it means hearing the speaker's own voice and
// reading the transcript of what they actually said.
//
// We store only BCP-47 codes here; display names are localized at render time via
// `Intl.DisplayNames([locale])` (the pattern already used elsewhere in App.tsx),
// so we don't hard-code English names or flags.
//
// Source: gemini-live-api-examples/.../lib/languages.ts (Haitian Creole is not in
// that list — Gemini Live Translate doesn't support it — so it's absent here too).

 * `===` (which transcript Y.Array it writes, whether a listener wants "Original", which
 * bridges the supervisor runs), so a code that is merely *plausible* rather than one of
 * these is not a near miss — it is a second spelling of a language the system already
 * has, and every one of those comparisons silently answers "different".
 *
 * `en-US` is the case that motivated this. It is a perfectly good BCP-47 tag, it is not
 * `en`, and declaring it as the spoken language buys a paid Gemini bridge translating
 * English into English that no listener can select. Normalizing it away would be worse:
 * the region subtag is real information (`pt-BR` is not `pt-PT`), and the code is a doc
 * key, so re-spelling it orphans transcripts already written. So the codes stay opaque
 * and this refuses anything that isn't one of them.
